Hi Fred,

Great talking with you again today and I'm looking forward to the prospect of working with you!

Please find attached the frontend dev test project we discussed and let me know if you have any questions.

Once you have reviewed, please provide me a summary of how you would implement the test project to demonstrate your understanding of the requirements. Please also provide an estimate (in number of hours) broken down how you see fit to allocate the time you would anticipate requiring in order to complete each core aspect, recognizing that unit tests are one such core aspect. Remember, you do not need to actually complete the test project, just the aforementioned summary and estimates.

After I receive and review your summary and estimates, I will shoot you a Calendly link to schedule a final interview to review the information you put together.

Thanks,

Dan
